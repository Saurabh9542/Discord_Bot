##How to use it.
1. Firstly you will be needing your Paid OPENAI API_KEY and Your Discord_API_KEY to make it work.
2. Use ```git clone <url to my repe>``` to clone the repo
3. Run ```pip install -r requiremnets-txt``` to install all the required dependicies.
4. Create a congig file and add both the apis or use os module to add your APIs.
5. Run ```python3 main.py``` for running the server.
